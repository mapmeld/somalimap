# SomaliMap

Working toward a JavaScript library to animate changing borders / regions

Borders 'flow' to their new locations, through their new polygon boundaries, using a wayfinding algorithm for game engines called A* (A Star).

<a href="http://mapmeld.github.com/somalimap/leafletstar.html">This map</a> uses a JavaScript implementation of A* from Brian Grinstead. <a href="http://www.briangrinstead.com/blog/astar-search-algorithm-in-javascript">See his blog post</a>.

Working on Leaflet.js library first, then D3
