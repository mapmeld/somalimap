Unlike the self-declared state of the Republic of Somaliland, Galmudug is similar to the northeast Somalia region Puntland in that it is not trying to obtain international recognition as a nation. It seeks to become a federal division within a united federal republic of Somalia, such as defined by the 2004 Transitional Federal Charter (TFC).<\/p>\n\n<p><u>Wikipedia<\/u>.
